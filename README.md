Utils to implement, train and evaluate diverse deep learning models.

## Package organization
- ```callbacks``` : 
- ```io``` : generators and everything used to load and save data
- ```layers/``` : some custom layers to build neural networks
- ```models/``` : full implementation of neural networks
- ```generators.py``` : data generators are used to avoid loading all the data in RAM
- ```losses.py``` : custom loss functions
